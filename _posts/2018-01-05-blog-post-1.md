Due to the nature of the work, many Red Teamers have a much stronger focus on Windows Enterprise networks. Because of this, Red Teamers have a myriad of tools and experience querying Active Directory from a windows box. Many Red Teamers start off with the common `net user`, `net group`, `net localgroup` commands, and now everybody is familiar with Will Shroeder’s [PowerView project](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/dev/Recon). Some red teamers still want to use something like `dsquery` to do some custom LDAP queries like `dsquery * -filter “(&(objectclass=group)(name=*admin*))” -limit 1` (this is also possible with PowerView).  You can even run something like the [BloodHound Project](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) to quickly get an insane amount of Active Directory information if you have the ability to run PowerShell or C# code. What if you’re on a Mac though?

I’m going to discuss a few different methods for doing some AD recon on a Mac with strictly built-in tools by comparing them to the more common Windows versions. Let’s start with a sample useful command and break it down:

`dscl “/Active Directory/TEST/All Domains” read “/Groups/Domain Admins” member memberof`

Ok, so what’s actually happening here? `dscl` (/usr/bin/dscl) is MacOS’ directory service command line utility. It allows users to not only query different directory services, but configure them as well (with appropriate permissions). The general format for it is `dscl [options] [datasource [command]]`. For our purposes, we’re going to be using two different data sources - **local** and the **domain’s active directory**. To query the local system, we use **“.”**, and to query AD we use **“/Active Directory”** in place of the datasource.

The structure for this is based off of Apple’s old NetInfo Directory structure, and now includes some mix of their Open Directory (which is a fork of OpenLDAP) and Microsoft’s Active Directory. `dscl` can be used interactively by simple running `dscl` without any arguments. From here, you can use `ls` and `cd` to browse around the directory structure. Once you get down to a specific element, you will either `read` it or `cat` it (they alias to the same thing). In our example, **TEST** is the NETBIOS name for the current domain we’re in. 

You can also browse around the structure atomically with commands like:

`dscl “/Active Directory/TEST/All Domains” ls /`

This will enumerate the highest-level directory structure for Active Directory in the domain. This will be the same for every Domain, but will be a little different when we enumerate locally. To illustrate the differences, the local query is below on the left and the domain query is on the right:
