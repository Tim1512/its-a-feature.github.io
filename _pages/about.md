In an attempt to start contributing back to the security community, I am starting a new blog series about Red Teaming for and with Macs. Macs seem to be more and more popular, but most red teaming blogs are exclusively Windows based. In conjunction with these blog posts, I will be releasing tools to help with red teamers on Macs.

This is just a blog for personal coding projects, blog posts, and other interesting things that relate to red teaming, pen testing, CTFs, etc. By hosting it here, I can easily reference other github repositories and gists.
